          <h3>Photography</h3>
          <p class="cdesc1">I have practiced photography since my late teens but have only started to take it more seriously in the last 10 years. From purchasing my first entry level DSLR my results have been mixed array of success and failure with much tweaking of my learning along the way. My speciality is landscape photography, and it works well with my love of camping holidays and exploring the land of the country where I live. Recently this personal journey has seen me embark on a degree course in photography.</p>

          <h3>Baking</h3>
          <p class="cdesc2">This is a passion I have had since my school years and for a time I worked in a school kitchen to get some experience of this on a mass scale. I can turn my hand to most things on a culinary level, but baking is where I shine. I have a fondness for creating sweet treats in the kitchen, my carrot cake always seems to please</p>
